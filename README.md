# sudoku_python

This is a python based sudoku problem solver and generator.

This code took a lot of inspiration from this article https://norvig.com/sudoku.html. The way sudoku grid is saved and used, is similar to the article. 

Both bfs and dfs approach were implemented to solve a puzzle (iterative_solver() and recursive_soler() respetively). Also there is a function that removes both hidden pair and naked pair.
